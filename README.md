### Short description
#### Asteroids styled game inspired by Ares, a 1997 game developed by Nathan Lamont. All of the media, images and sprites are credited to Nathan Lamont. 

### Objective
#### The objective of this game is the blow up all the asteroids in your realm of space without dying. Asteroids colliding with you will deal minor damage. As an asteroid is destroyed, it breaks down into many smaller asteroids...so be careful! Physics are also built into the game environment so that the asteroids will move in a natural manner. If an asteroids is bigger (more mass) than another asteroids (smaller mass), than a collision between the two will have the smaller asteroid taking on a much faster exit velocity. It will get pretty dicey once all the big asteroids are blown up!

### Enemies
#### There is only one "enemy" present in this game. This is what we call a Flak Drone. The Flak Drone has a high health pool and has very powerful weapons. It is equipped with a CMissle and Flak. It has a fairly high fire rate, so if you find yourself flying inside it's range, be careful!

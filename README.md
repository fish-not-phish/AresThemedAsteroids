#### Using the arrow keys, you can accelerate with the UP arrow key, stop with the DOWN arrow key, turn left with the LEFT arrow key, and turn right with the RIGHT arrow key.
#### Using space, you can shoot your main weapon. Shift is the secondary weapon, and pressing C will launch the ships special weapon (if the ship you are using has one).

### Enemies
#### There is only one "enemy" present in this game. This is what we call a Flak Drone. The Flak Drone has a high health pool and has very powerful weapons. It is equipped with a CMissle and Flak. It has a fairly high fire rate, so if you find yourself flying inside it's range, be careful!
